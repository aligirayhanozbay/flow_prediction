his repository includes Tensorflow-based implementations of several machine learning models for the reconstruction of unsteady two- and three-dimensional fluid flows around arbitrary objects using a Schwarz-Christoffel conformal mapping based dense field sampling strategy.

The mappings are computed using [pydscpack](https://github.com/aligirayhanozbay/pydscpack), a set of Python bindings to a numerical Schwarz-Christoffel mapping computation package by [Hu (1998)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/292395.291204).

For greater detail, please see [our paper](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0087488) describing the methodology:
